    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
    <p>As the Clone Wars rage across the galaxy, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi embark on a daring mission to rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the clutches of the Separatists. Meanwhile, Anakin is haunted by visions of his wife Padmé Amidala dying in childbirth. Desperate to prevent this fate, he begins to grow closer to Palpatine, who promises forbidden knowledge that could save her.</p>

    <p>Palpatine, revealed to be the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, manipulates Anakin’s fear and distrust of the Jedi Council to turn him against his allies. As the Jedi begin to suspect Palpatine’s intentions, Anakin's inner conflict reaches its peak. He ultimately pledges allegiance to the dark side, taking the name Darth Vader and helping Sidious execute Order 66, resulting in the massacre of nearly all Jedi.</p>

    <p>With the Republic transformed into the Galactic Empire, Obi-Wan confronts his fallen apprentice in a dramatic and emotional lightsaber duel on the volcanic planet Mustafar. The final battle severs what remains of Anakin's humanity, setting the stage for the rise of Darth Vader and the dark reign of the Empire. The film ends with hope for the future as Padmé’s twin children, Luke and Leia, are hidden away from the Empire.</p>
